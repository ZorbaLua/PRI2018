    The Quran
    
      Translated by M. H. Shakir
    
  
  
    About this edition
    This electronic edition was prepared from publicly available anonymous files claiming to be "electronically scanned versions of M. H. Shakir's translation of the Holy Qur'an, as published by Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an, Inc., P.O. Box 1115, Elmhurst,
      New York 11373." During preparation of this edition, however, a passage was found (24:26) in which different words had been substituted for the language used in the currently available edition distributed by Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an. While the revised
      text of the "scanned" version agrees more closely with other English translations than Shakir's does, it omits the final clause of the passage. The version of that passage used here is from J. M. Rodwell's 1909 translation.
    In the absence of a detailed comparison of the printed and scanned versions, the extent to which the text of this book deviates from Shakir's translation remains an open question. Readers are advised to refer directly to the printed version
      published by Tahrike Tarsile Qur'an for the authoritative text of this translation.
    Both the printed version of this translation and the scanned files made from it have been published and freely distributed internationally without copyright. Distribution of this electronic edition is governed by whatever unstated conditions apply
      to distribution of the printed original.
